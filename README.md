# React-Folder-Templates
My intial script for creating the file structure. I don't recommend using this as it is quite difficult to use, difficult to extend, and limited in its functionality.

The preferred way to use this is to download the Command Runner extension by Edonet in VSCode. Then, add the provided settings to VSCode's settings.json. This should give you access to the script through the command palette (labled "Create React component with index.js"). You should run the command in the folder you wish to create the template. When prompted, enter the desired name for your component.

Alternatively, you can run the bat file directly from the command line. It takes two arguments; the first is your desired name for the component, and the second is the path to where the component should be created.
